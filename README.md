<h2><b>Football Fixtures Generator Implementation in python<b></h2>
<p>In ABC premier league, there are 10 teams. You have been hired to build a program that will generate
  fixtures for these teams based on the following given rules:</p>
  <li>
 A team must play every other team twice, i.e. in their home stadium and away stadium. At some point,
teams from the same local town will have to play each other, these teams should only meet after they
have played teams from other local towns.
    </li>
  <li>
 Only 4 teams can play in a given weekend, for example CKlein Stars vs Dolpins FC and Wolves FC
vs Sea Horses FC.
  </li>
  <li>
While developing the fixtures, indicate the local town, stadium, leg (i.e. 1 or 2) and the weekend
(indicate as weekend #1, weekend #2 etc.) the teams are meant to meet.
  </li>
  
 Generate and display the final table in a .csv, .txt or .xlsx files (and on screen) to show the generated fixtures
